## Buergeria otai is a species of frog whose tadpoles have been found in hot springs upwards of 40 degrees Celsius. Previous testing has indicated that the genes responsible are located on chromosome 2, but we are unsure where. Perform a differential expression analysis. 
## Detail the steps that you take and provide the necessary intermediate results for each step. 
## Submit a final list of the genes identified as differentially expressed in the reference annotation and provide the expected function of the result with the highest difference in expression value (regardless of significance).
